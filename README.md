# EMI-CDAT: Ethiopian Meteorological Institute Climate Data Analysis Tool  üå¶Ô∏èüåçüöÄ

EMI-CDAT is designed to streamline the data workflow within the Meteorological Data and Climatology Directorate of the Ethiopian Meteorological Institute. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the production of climate bulletins, including monthly, seasonal, and annual reports. Here are the key features of EMI-CDAT:

1. **Automated Data Processing**:
   - EMI-CDAT automates the generation of charts, graphs, maps, and tabular outputs required for climate bulletins.
   - It handles data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization seamlessly.

2. **Built with Streamlit**:
   - The application is constructed and deployed using the Streamlit application development framework.
   - Streamlit provides an intuitive interface for creating interactive web apps with Python.

3. **Integration of Data Libraries**:
   - EMI-CDAT leverages various data analysis and visualization libraries, including:
     - Plotly: For interactive charts and graphs
     - SciPy: For scientific computing and statistical analysis
     - Cartopy: For geospatial data visualization
     - Geopandas: For handling geospatial data
     - Xarray: For working with labeled multi-dimensional arrays
     - Verde: For gridding and interpolation
     - Scikit-learn (Sklearn): For machine learning tasks
     - Shapely: For geometric operations
     - Regionmask: For region-based masking
     - Pykrige: For kriging interpolation
     - Seaborn: For statistical data visualization

4. **Modularized System**:
   - EMI-CDAT follows a modularized approach, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
   - Well-defined modules enable independent development and testing.
   - This structure leads to faster development cycles and robust applications.

By combining these features, EMI-CDAT provides an efficient and well-structured tool for climate data analysis and reporting.
